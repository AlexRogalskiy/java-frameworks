# Java Frameworks Implementations  

Personal working implementations of Java Frameworks to test several features. The testing frameworks will not compile as they're only to show how to write code which works and I do not want to implement an empty _Spring Application_.  

You may find my personal notes for some of this Frameworks at [my blog](https://mariocodes.github.io/).  

### Lombok  
Tested the possibility to automatically create Builders from Java classes with `@Builder`. It does not auto-fill fields. It provides a really basic API.

### Codearte's Catch Exception  
Small API to improve testing of when Exceptions are thrown and when they shouldn't be. It works at best together with `AssertJ` and `Mockito`.
