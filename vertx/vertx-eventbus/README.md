### Vertx Eventbus examples
The consumer and the producer have been created as 2 projects, to be able to execute them as standalone Verticles from CLI. 
To start them, **we must do so** with -cluster option enabled, so Vertx searches for other verticles and manages the connection.   

###### Simple  
Sends just a String  

###### Complex  
Sends a complete POJO  

###### Multilanguage  
Connects verticles in different programming languages
